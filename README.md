# Spelling-Bee-Project
This is Spelling Bee Project implemented using Java Swing and SQL.
The program allows the user to play a Spelling Bee Game similar to New York Time's Spelling Bee, with the user making as mant words as possible using the given characters.
The user's results are uploaded to a SQL database along with their name.
These scores can then be accessed by the LeaderBoard and UserScoreBoard classes to display high scores.
The Query and Test classes have been modified to work with the databases for this Project.
